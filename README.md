# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
A Random Forest Classification model to predict Heart Disease

## Introduction
The Heart Disease Dataset contains a number of variables that can be used to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. Each attribute potentially contributes information that could be used to determine heart disease risk.

Dataset Features:
1. Age: The patient's age in years.
2. Sex: The patient's sex (1 = male, 0 = female).
3. Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced (values ranging from 1 to 4).
4. Resting Blood Pressure: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
5. Serum Cholestrol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
6. Fasting Blood Sugar: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
7. Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2).
8. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate achieved during thallium stress test.
9. Exercise Induced Angina: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
10. ST Depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
12. Number of Major Vessels: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
13. Thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect).

Target Variable:
Heart Disease Presence: The presence of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes).
